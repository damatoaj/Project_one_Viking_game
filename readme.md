I. Game Idea
    A. Hnefatafl
        a. there are two teams: attackers and defenders. The attackers have 16 pieces and are trying to kill the king. Defenders have 9 pieces including a king piece, and win if the king reaches the edge of the board
        b. All pieces move in cardinal directions; only one direction at a time; 
        c. pawns of both armies die if they are trapped between two pieces of the opposing army. or between an opponent and the castle (center square)
        d. the king dies if trapped between for pieces of the opposing army or three pieces and the castle
        e. pieces cannot go through each other or the castle
II. Tech Stack
    A. Javascript
    B. CSS
    C. HTML
III. WireFrames
    A. Header
    B. Board
        a. 9 * 9 board
            i. make the board with a flex wrap
            ii. center tile has to have different rules so the it can register collisions and thereby kill pieces
            iii. edge tiles need special rules to register collisions with the king and trigger vicory
        b. center tile is the castle
        c. start tiles for the game pieces are fixed and color coded
    C. Footer: displays turns and winner.
    D. Timed reset after victory
IV. MVP Goals
    A. Fully rendered game board
    B. Fully rendered pieces
        a. piecemeal each of the steps for clicking and move pieces
    C. Pieces able to move appropriately
V. Stretch Goals
    A. Make the tiles stylized
    B. Banner animations for victory or defeat
    C. Add in Medieval music with controls for it
VI. Any roadblocks
    A. Getting the tic-tac-toe assignment finished in addtion to the project will slow me down
    B. I still have difficulty understanding javascript, and how to make it grab items that I would want to use



    React native;
