            <b>Goals</b></br></br>
                The defenders <small>(Player One)</small> win if the king <small>(center)</small> escapes to any of the corner tiles</br>
                The attackers <small>(Player Two)</small> win if they capture the king, by surrounding him on four sides.</br></br>
            <b>Movement</b></br></br>
                Any piece may move any number of vacant spaces in any straight line.</br>
                No piece may ever pass over another piece in its path.</br>
                An enemy piece is captured and removed from the board if you move one of your pieces so that the enemy piece becomes surrounded on two opposite sides. </br>
                A piece may be moved in between two enemy pieces without being captured.</br></br>
